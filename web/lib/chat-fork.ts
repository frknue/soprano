/**
 * Fork targets for the message transcript.
 *
 * omp's `branch` RPC command — what the UI calls "fork" / "New session" —
 * only accepts a **user** message entry. Verified against a live
 * `omp --mode rpc-ui`: branching at an assistant entry answers
 * `success:false, error:"Invalid entry ID for branching"`. The new session
 * holds the history *before* that user entry, and the command returns the
 * entry's prompt text so the client can offer it for editing and re-sending.
 *
 * The UI offers the action on every message and resolves each one to a branch
 * point omp supports:
 * - a user message forks at itself and its prompt is put back into the
 *   composer (edit-and-resend, like omp's TUI `/branch`);
 * - an assistant reply forks at the NEXT user prompt, so the new session keeps
 *   that reply (and the rest of its turn) in its history;
 * - the newest reply has no next prompt, so it falls back to its own turn's
 *   prompt with the edit-and-resend prefill (#103).
 * Editing the first prompt would fork into an empty session, so rows that
 * resolve to that have no fork target, nor do rows with no usable user entry.
